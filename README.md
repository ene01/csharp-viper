# üêçViper
**Because snake is a boring name.**
### What is this?
**csharp-viper** or **Viper** as i used to call it, is a remake of an old snake game i made in [WinForms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/overview/?view=netdesktop-9.0) with the [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) language, that old version is basically lost to time but i do have some old code and builds. **Viper** uses WPF as some sort of game engine, Panels hold multiple elements and some Decorators are used for UI scaling and stuff, WPF handles all thing realted to colors, events, text wrapping and stuff.

### OK can i play it?
The **Viper.Desktop** project should have been the "main game", but it doesn't do anything because i wanted to add everything when all the code and elements were finished, so the only way to play is to download the code, open with [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) and compile and run **Viper.Tests**, that project basically contains all the code i was working with, its like a unit test but i didn't know anything about that in that moment (i still don't).

### This code is awful
All my code is awful, i am still learning C# currently, and i don't know if i will ever work for a company or something like that, currently my scope is just to do silly personal projects.
