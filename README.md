# What is this?

**csharp-viper** or **Viper** as i used to call it, is a remake of an old snake game i made in [WinForms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/overview/?view=netdesktop-9.0) with the [Visual Basic .NET](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_.NET) language. That old version is basically lost to time but i do have some old code and builds.


# OK can i play it?
The **Viper.Desktop** project should have been the "main game", but it doesn't do anything because i wanted to add everything when all the code and elements are finished, so the only way to play is to download the code, open with [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) and compile and run **Viper.Tests**, that project basically contains all the code i was working with, its like a unit test but i didn't know anything about that in that moment (i still don't).


# This code is awful
All my code is awful, i am still learning C# currently, and i don't know if i will ever work for a company or something like that, currently my scope is just to do silly personal projects.
